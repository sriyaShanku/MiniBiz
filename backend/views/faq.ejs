                        <p>On each product/service detail page and on the seller's profile page, you will find a "Contact Seller" button or link. This will typically allow you to send a message directly through the MiniBiz platform (requires login for tracking) or may display contact information provided by the seller (like an email or phone number if they chose to share it).</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Currently, MiniBiz primarily acts as a connection platform. Payment arrangements are typically made directly between the customer and the seller using methods they both agree upon (e.g., cash, bank transfer, third-party payment apps). Always discuss payment terms clearly with the seller beforehand. <br><em>(Note: When Stripe is integrated, this answer will change.)</em></p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We encourage direct communication with the seller first to resolve any issues. MiniBiz acts as a platform provider and does not directly mediate disputes related to transactions.
